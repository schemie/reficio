# reficio

Reficio is a simple WPF program to convert plain text, rtf, and HTML files to PDF. It relys on the C# libraries [RtfPipe](https://github.com/erdomke/RtfPipe), and [Shark.PdfConvert](https://github.com/cp79shark/Shark.PdfConvert). We needed a better solution to convert large volumes of RTF files to PDF where I work. There are many expensive proprietary solutions that we have tried for this task.

This started largly as a project to learn C#. It was originally a console app but I was interested in learning a GUI framework. Since I was already learning C#, WPF made sense.
